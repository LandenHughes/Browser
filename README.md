# Browser
A small-scale python web browser. Currently still a work in progress!

## Usage
Make sure to clone all 3 required files: browser.py, browser.css, and runtime.js. In a terminal, run *python browser.py <optional URL>* . If no URL is supplied to the command line, the browser will open to the textbook that this project is based off of!
